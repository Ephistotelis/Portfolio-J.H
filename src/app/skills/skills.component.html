        <p>Here you can check my current skillset! Until now my main stack is based on front-end technologies. I started building my projects with HTML, CSS and JS. Nowadays i am mainly using Angular as framwork, where I also learned to use Typescript and
            SCSS. I am already on it to get experience in back-end technologies. As soon as I am confident with it, I am gonna add it to my skillset aswell. I already worked with Google Firebase, Databases and APIÂ´s.</p>
