            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a German speaking Web Developer with experience in building web apps with JavaScript & Angular. Currently my main stack is focused on front-end technologies. My future goal is, to become a full-stack or fulltime back-end developer with
                a specialisation in IT-Security. To achieve this I am already in progress with learning back-end technologies and building projects.
